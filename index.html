            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p><strong>Bio</strong></p>
            <p>
                Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a former fashion
                merchandising graduate, makeup artist, and hair color specialist
                originally from Dallas, Texas.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating from The University of North Texas with my
                bachelors in Fashion Merchandising in 2016, I relocated to
                Portland, Oregon to pursue a formal career in the beauty
                industry. I quickly fell in love with hair color theory and upon
                graduation began my path to becoming a color specialist with a
                focus in color correction and creative color.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, after spending over 10 years in the beauty industry I
                knew I wanted to start on a journey to find something I am just
                as passionate about but would provide a more stable work-life
                balance. Enter software development!After the unfortunate closure of my first coding bootcamp in
                early 2023 I was determined to keep on my path to becoming an
                employed developer. While I was only 30 days in at the time of
                the closure, I knew I loved software development and would do
                everything in my power to find a new program to guide me along
                my path. As of May 2023, I began a new program at Epicodus in
                Portland, Oregon and am back on track.
            </p>

            <p>
                My background as a hair color specialist and makeip artist has
                taught me how to solve problems using creative solutions. I love
                to learn the rules then having the creative freedom come up with
                my own ways of implementing them while keeping my code clean and
                concise, just as you need to do as a successful colorist. I also
                might or might not have built MySpace layouts that I would sell
                to my classmates in high school, so I’m basically living my 16
                year old self’s dream - but that’s neither here nor there.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Interests</strong></p>
            <p>
                Even though I left the industries behind I still love all things
                fashion and beauty. In my spare time - when I'm not spending time with my fur babies - I enjoy working on
                color projects and flexing my creative muscles as much as I can.
                I've also become a lover of all things nature and you can find
                me hiking my way through the Pacific Northwest on the weekends and any time off
                I get.
